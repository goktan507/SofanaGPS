#### Introduction
Grand Canyon University is in the heart of Phoenix Arizona, the hottest city in the country. Getting from point A to point B on GCU’s ever-growing developing campus can be a challenge. Currently, GCU operates golf carts to aid students in traversing the campus. Although these golf carts are tremendously helpful, there have been reports from students that they are unable to locate a golf cart promptly when needed. Team Sofana’s goal is to utilize technology and create software that aids students in locating a golf cart so they can arrive at their destination on time.
